Welcome to my website! Here, you'll find information about me, and how I make a dent in the coding community (unfortunatly, not a very big one).

First of all, about me.

__About Me__
I'm on Scratch, an educational programming language. I'm working on the HTML-OS (at github.com/html-os-org) and the PocketWiki (click the link at the top). I like _sans-serif_, _Markdown_, The _Nashville Predators_, and _HTML_. I'm also a GitHuber.

__Projects__
My projects are:

- [HTML-OS](github.com/HTML-OS-ORG)
- [Pocketwiki](grinthy.github.io/wiki/home.md)

This site is written in Markdown, except the redirection pages, those are HTML with JS embedded.
